# Insurance Charges Prediction Project - Linear Regression
## Objective
Primary Goal: To develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate individual medical charges based on personal attributes.
## Challenges
- Dealing with mixed data types (numerical and categorical).
- Ensuring data quality and handling any missing or anomalous data.
- Encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical features for model compatibility.
- Identifying key variables influencing medical charges.

  ## Tasks
1.	Data Preprocessing
o	Handle missing or anomalous data.
o	Convert categorical data (sex, smoker, region) to numerical formats.
o	Standardize numerical features (age, bmi, children, charges).
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Analyze distributions of key variables like age, bmi, and charges.
o	Investigate relationships between features and the target variable (charges).
3.	Model Development
o	Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
o	Implement a linear regression model.
o	Evaluate model performance (R-squared, Mean Squared Error).

## Solutions and Outcomes
•	Utilized Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data processing and modeling.
•	Successfully cleaned and transformed the data, removing duplicates and encoding categorical variables.
•	Conducted comprehensive EDA, revealing important insights like the significant impact of smoking on charges.
•	Developed a linear regression model that explains approximately 77% of the variance in medical charges (R² = 0.77).
•	The model's Mean Squared Error (MSE) was around 0.27, indicating a reasonable prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion
•	The project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression in predicting medical charges based on personal attributes.
•	Key Findings: Smoking status, age, and BMI are significant predictors of medical charges.
•	Future work could explore more complex models or techniques to further improve predictive accuracy.
