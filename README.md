Medical Charges Prediction Project
Objective
Primary Goal: To develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate individual medical charges based on personal attributes.
Challenges
Dealing with mixed data types (numerical and categorical).
Ensuring data quality and handling any missing or anomalous data.
Encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical features for model compatibility.
Identifying key variables influencing medical charges.
Tasks
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing or anomalous data.
Convert categorical data (sex, smoker, region) to numerical formats.
Standardize numerical features (age, bmi, children, charges).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze distributions of key variables like age, bmi, and charges.
Investigate relationships between features and the target variable (charges).
Model Development
Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
Implement a linear regression model.
Evaluate model performance (R-squared, Mean Squared Error).
Solutions and Outcomes
Utilized Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data processing and modeling.
Successfully cleaned and transformed the data, removing duplicates and encoding categorical variables.
Conducted comprehensive EDA, revealing important insights like the significant impact of smoking on charges.
Developed a linear regression model that explains approximately 77% of the variance in medical charges (RÂ² = 0.77).
The model's Mean Squared Error (MSE) was around 0.27, indicating a reasonable prediction accuracy.
Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression in predicting medical charges based on personal attributes.
Key Findings: Smoking status, age, and BMI are significant predictors of medical charges.
Future work could explore more complex models or techniques to further improve predictive accuracy.
